## Page Structure
My page consists of two main parts: the head and the body. In the head you can find a picture of me, and some relevant data about myself which includes my name, what I'm qualified to work as, a phone number and an email as a way of contacting me. These two objects are displayed in a row with a separator in between. The body is divided into three blocks: "Qualifications", "Presentation" and "Experience". Each block is then divided into two parts: the title and the text. Inside the "Qualifications" block there's a list of all the official qualifications I have. As for the presentation, there you can find where I live, what I'm passionate about, how is my character and some good and bad things of mine. Finally, for the "Experience" block, there I've put all the jobs I've been through.

## Visual design
The most important decision I've made about the design of this project is to keep it simple but clean. This has led me to using only three colors: ultraviolet for the background and emphasis, black for the body text and white for the whole head and the body's titles. With this approach, I've also kept the body whole, placing the blocks of information in a single column and with some margin on the sides. The blocks themselves are also really simple, having a title with background to better recognize the start of a block and the content which may be in the form of a list or a text. Regardless of the form of the content, to highlight the most important things, as I've said before, I used the same color as the background and also added some weight to the font. The head meanwhile is structured in a row, has a different background color, as there is where you can find the most important information, and has no side margins at all. Finally, for the fonts in this page, there are only two I've picked from Google Fonts, Joan and Kantumruy Pro which I think are very elegant but still simple. The first one I've used it for the head and the body's titles and the second one is just for the body's text.
